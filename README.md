# MazeSolvingRobot
When program start create random maze then robot will solve the maze

I used the recursive backtracker method for draw the maze. First i set the start and finish position then from the start point i start to draw  the maze 
Robot only knows that finish is on the final row of the maze and because of that robot will try to go south than east and west than north.
If robot will be stuck than it will go to previous position.
Thats the way my robot find the exit.
